			<h3>Visual identity</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>For the »TRANSITIONS. Festival of Contemporary Jewish Arts«, <a target="_blank" class="externalLink" href="https://ipekerdol.com">İpek Erdöl</a> and I created a visual identity, print (posters, flyers, catalogue) and online (<a href="../transitions-website/index.html">Website</a> and Instragram) materials. To visually translate the festival's theme of transitions as "the liminal space, a “betwixt and between” state, where the usual order of things is disrupted and new potentials and limits can be challenged and explored", our designs used fragments that de- and reassemble into different shapes. Some elements, such as the gold and blue colors, were based on Dagesh, the host organization's branding.</p>
			<p>The <a target="_blank" class="externalLink" href="https://dagesh.de/transitions">three-day festival</a> presented a diversity of contemporary artistic perspectives and practices that navigate the space between protest and resistance, solidarity and reinvention. It invited artists and the public to celebrate the Art of Resistance and to a pan-European, trans-Atlantic exchange to explore new social conditions and visions.</p>
