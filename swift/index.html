			<p>This booklet was the result of a short assignment in first year of university that was meant to showcase a given typeface. It showcases the typeface "Swift", which features very characteristic and bold serifs that we used as a defining visual concept throughout the booklet. The historical context of this typeface is explored, as well: For example, the early industrial printing process was the reason for such serifs, which were designed to maximize readability despite imperfections created by the new mass printing processes. For visuals and graphic elements we deconstructed the typeface and played with typographic details as well as analogue effects like transparent paper and related imagery.</p>
