			<p>For <a class="externalLink" target="_blank" href="tacticaltech.org">tactical tech</a>'s 2019 annual report I created key visuals, the publication's layout as well as data visualizations. The key visual (used as cover) was generated by stacking all imagery the NGO's various projects had published throughout the year  – a concept that could be applied in following years to generate new graphics based on that specific year's output. We included creative visualizations of quantitative data from different projects to communicate achievements and impact. The layout was made to work both in print (in an A5 booklet format) as well as in digital form on a wide screen.</p>
