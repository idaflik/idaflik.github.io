			<h2>STAGE DESIGN AT RC3</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3>Design for the OIO stage at the Chaos Computer Club's 2020 annual conference: rc3 - remote chaos experience
			</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Justus Pfeifer, Paula</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>As the Chaos Computer Club's annual conference was redesigned to be online in 2020, I was asked to design the interior for one of the many remote locations from where talks, workshops, Q&As and fun little extras were broadcast. As the conference's online interface was based on a low-resolution gaming map, we decided to play with the crossover of analogue and digital, creating decorations with large pixels that would appear on screens as on a flat surface but in reality, varying in size a lot; and creating tape-art that was spectacularly distorted in space, but created neat graphics from the perspective where webcams were installed.
