			<h3>A Behind the Scenes Look Into 10 Years of Alarm Phone</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>To mark ten years of the network's, <a href="https://alarmphone.org"  target = "_blank" class = "externalLink">Alarm Phone</a> (AP) activists created a book as part of a collaboration with the Bard College's Center for Human Rights and the Arts (CHRA) and I contributed with some graphic design, layout and collages. <a href= "https://chra.bard.edu/resource/10-years-of-alarm-phone/" target = "_blank" class = "externalLink">CHRA</a> writes on their website: <br>"The publication offers intimate reflections on AP's activism across diverse geographical contexts. Ranging in visual and written expressions from collages to illustrations and photographs, the multilingual publication offers insight into how AP navigates the political realities of migration in the Mediterranean Sea. Through affect, personal narratives, and experiential knowledge as essential elements of their praxis, the publication is designed to simultaneously offer glimpses about AP's mission and exist as a time capsule for past, present, and future members of the activist network."</p>
