			<h3>Design for the OIO stage at rc3
			</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Justus Pfeifer</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>As the Chaos Computer Club's annual conference was redesigned to be online in 2020 (rc3 - remote chaos experience), I was asked to design the interior for one of the many remote locations from where talks, workshops, Q&As and fun little extras were broadcast. 
				</p><p>As the conference's online interface was based on a low-resolution gaming map, we decided to play with the crossover of analogue and digital.  We painted decorations with large pixels that would appear as flat surfaces when watched through the stream, but which actually varied a lot in size when encountered in real space. We also used tape-art that was spectacularly distorted in space, but created neat graphics from the perspective where webcams were installed.
