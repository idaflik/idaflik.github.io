			<h2>Building alliances for a just transition</h2>
			<hr>
			<h3>Training manual</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>Solidar and The Olof Palme Center created a train-the-trainer <a target="_blank" class="externalLink" href="https://www.palmecenter.se/resourcecenter/environment-and-climate/building-alliances-on-just-transition/">curriculum</a> on Just Transition - a concept of climate justice that takes global inequalities & power structures as well as inequalities within a given region into account.</p><p>
				The training and its manual follow a previously published <a target="_blank" class="externalLink" href="https://www.solidar.org/en/publications/a-just-transition-for-the-global-south">case study</a> on Just Transition, and the design of the manual incorporated visual elements from the case study's design for a sense of coherence - e.g. colors, the cover illustration, and some fonts.<br>
				Various graphics were included in the manual, and to carry forward the hand-made feel of the cover illustration and for consistency within the manual, I recreated all graphics (except for photos) in the manual by hand-painting multi-layered versions.<br>
				The document is structured by color for the different modules, a colorful guide that is positioned on a different edge of the page depending on the current section, a status bar at the bottom of each page as well as two different font systems for the activity and knowledge parts of each section, respectively.</p>
