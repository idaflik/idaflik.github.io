			<h3>An installation-turned-animation about profit shares along a cup of coffee's supply chain
			</h3>
			<hr>
			<h5>Team: Heinrich Ehnert, Marcus Schwalm, Veronika Schneider</h5>
			<hr>
			<p>As part of a workshop on data visualization with <a class="externalLink" target="_blank" href="http://laloma.info">la loma</a>, we created a performance installation from data about coffee profit shares. For the performance, we prepared one cup of coffee and a chain of coffee filters - each representing one actor along the supply chain. The filters were treated with invisible impregnation spray so each one would only soak up as much of the coffee liquid as the accoring industry gets in profit shares, while the rest of the coffee continued dripping down, travelling further along the supply chain. The digital animation is made of photos we took during the performance.
